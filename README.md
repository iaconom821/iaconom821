- Hi, I’m Mike Iacono
- I’m many things. A thinker, an athlete, a caregiver, a husband, a son, a brother, and much more. Have a question? Ask
- I’m currently studying fullstack web development and data science. The goal is to generalize and understand the technology topics that can help make better designs and drive better decisions.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that serve others. Healthcare, education, technology are some of the fields I would like to work within.

Ask questions. Make a plan. Execute. Trust yourself
